    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  The first steps of pre-processing involve eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) which are implemented using the oXygen XML editor. Theoretically, it may be possible to use R with the package \"xslt\".\n",
    "\n",

    "**General Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many XML treebanks of individual works have been subdivided into parts, since the Perseids interface (http://sosol.perseids.org/sosol/) bogs down with files containing many more than one hundred sentences. As a result, there may be more than one series of sentence-level id attributes for a given treebank. This situations calls for the files to be consolidated and a single series of sentence id attributes to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    + Create a XML file to hold all parts of a given work and copy the first file of the work into it.\n",
    "    + Add a \"comment\" element just after the \"date\" element at the top of the file. As the body of the \"comment\" element, insert the form of the standard reference for the work, for example, \"Herodotus Book 1\". This information will be used to add human readable references to all sentences and words in the file. This step makes debugging easier in later stages of data processing.\n",
    "    + Add each additional part of the work's treebank to the end of the new XML file.\n",
    "    + Run the XSLT script called \"renumber_sent_consolidated_files.xsl\" on the new XML file. Each sentence in the output file will contain an attribute called \"consolidated_sent_id\". **Note Well: the output directory must be set correctly for each XSLT script.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Human readable metadata is now added to each sentence and word element.\n",
    "\n",
    "     + On the output of the preceding XSLT, run the XSLT called \"stand_ref_to_sent.xsl\". This step will create an sentence attribute called \"stand_ref\" and insert the text of the \"comment\" element into this attribute, for example, \"Aeschines Oration 1: s-1\".\n",
    "     + On the output of the preceding XSLT file, run the XSLT called \"stand_ref_to_word.xsl\". This step will create for each word and attribute called \"cite\" and insert human readable metadata for sentence and word, for example, \"Aeschines Oration 1: s-677 w-4\".\n",
    "     \n",
    "* All files should be checked for missing values in any word attributes. **Such missing data may cause the code to break at a later step.** \n",
    "\n",
    "    + Using the oXygen XML editor, use the \"search and replace in files funciton\" replace any empty quotation markes with \"missing_value\" or the like.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Some of the older files in the Perseus Treebank contain features which will break later stages of the code. These features should be removed:\n",
    "\n",
    "    + On the target XML files, run the XSLT called \"XSEG_removal.xsl\". The attribute relation=\"XSEG\" was a way to handle tokens improperly divided by the tokenizer. This method is no longer necessary, since the Arethusa/Alpheios platform now allows easy re-tokenization. The XSEG tag should therefore be avoided. **The code \"XSEG_removal.xsl\" will remove any sentence element containing a word with a relation attribute with the value \"XSEG\".**\n",
    "    + On the result of the preceding output, run the XSLT called \"bad_numbering removal.xsl\". Some older treebank files contain sentences in which the maximum value of the word id attributes does not match the number of tokens in the sentence. For example, a sentence might contain 10 word elements, but the id attribute of the last word in the sentence has the id value of 11. Such sentences will cause subsequent code to break. **The code \"bad_numbering_removal.xsl\" will remove any sentence element which has this unwanted characteristic.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "* These files are now ready for the next stage of processes sing, which add some basic data about word order as attributes to each word. This process is relatively complicated.\n",
